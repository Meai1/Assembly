# Assembly
My assembly language exercises from the book
Introduction to 64 Bit Assembly Language Programming for Linux and OS X

I'm doing all of my work on an Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.3 virtual machine
running on Virtualbox on my laptop.

Assemble:

yasm -f elf64 -P ../../ebe/ebe.inc -g dwarf2 -l ex1.lst ex1.asm

Link with start:

ld -o ex1.exe ex1.o

Link with main:

gcc -o ex2.exe ex2.o

I found what seems to be a bug in yasm related to debugging.
I discussed this on Stackoverflow in this thread:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42079191/unexplained-segmentation-fault-running-to-breakpoint-in-gdb-in-x86-64-yasm-assem

I redid chapter 9 exercise 2 using nasm and plan to use nasm instead of yasm as my assembler to see
if it works better with gdb the debugger.

Here is the nasm command I'm using:

nasm -f elf64 ex1.asm -o ex1.o -l ex1.lst -g -F dwarf; ld -o ex1.exe ex1.o; gdb ex1.exe

Note that I also left off the ebe.inc parameter. I have been using gdb only and not the ebe utility that 
the book recommends. It is just easier for me to do everything command line through putty.  Also, I think
that nasm may be a little more widely used than yasm so I don't mind switching over in case I do anything
with x86-64 assembly after working through this book.
